This is one of the chatbot application for the covid-19 updates to the users.

Azure services used in this project :
1. QNA
2. Static webapps 
3. Azure Bot Service

Following are some key features of Azure Static Web Apps that made me choose this service:

1.Web hosting for static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
2.Integrated API support provided by Azure Functions with the option to link an existing Azure Functions app using a standard account.
3.First-class GitHub and Azure DevOps integration where repository changes trigger builds and deployments.
4.Globally distributed static content, putting content closer to your users.
5.Free SSL certificates, which are automatically renewed.
6.Custom domains to provide branded customizations to our app.
